# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
This project presents an interactive **Coffee Sales Dashboard** built in **Power BI**, designed to analyze sales performance across different coffee products, time periods, and customer behavior dimensions.
The objective of this dashboard is not just visualization, but to **answer stakeholder-driven business questions** and enable ongoing performance monitoring.

---

## 🧠 Business Questions Addressed
The dashboard focuses on answering key business questions such as:
- How are total coffee sales trending over time?
- Which coffee categories contribute the most to overall revenue?
- What are the peak selling periods during the day (Morning / Afternoon / Night)?
- How do sales vary across weekdays?
- Which coffee products consistently outperform or underperform?

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked
- **Total Sales**
- **Total Transactions**
- **Average Sales per Transaction**
- Sales contribution by coffee category
- Sales distribution by time of day and weekday

---

## 🔍 Dashboard Features
- **Product-level drilldown:** Analyze individual coffee types such as Latte, Cappuccino, Americano, Espresso, etc.
- **Time-based analysis:** Monthly sales trends and cumulative sales progression.
- **Segmentation analysis:** Sales by weekday and period of the day.
- **Contribution analysis:** Revenue share by coffee category.
- **Minimal, stakeholder-friendly design:** Focused on clarity and usability rather than visual clutter.

---

## 🧩 Analytical Approach
The dashboard is built on the following analytical components:
- Trend analysis over time
- Cumulative sales tracking
- Product contribution analysis
- Behavioral segmentation by time and weekday

All metrics are designed to support **monitoring, comparison, and prioritization**, rather than one-time exploration.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI**
- **DAX** for calculated measures and KPIs
- Transaction-level coffee sales dataset

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaway
> Dashboards do not create insights — they operationalize analysis.  
This project demonstrates how clearly defined questions and structured metrics can translate raw sales data into decision-ready insights for stakeholders.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add comparative KPIs (MoM / YoY)
- Introduce alert-style indicators for underperforming products
- Extend analysis to customer-level behavior if data is available

---

## 📂 Use Case
This dashboard is suitable for:
- Café owners and managers
- Sales and operations teams
- Business and data analysts interested in BI storytelling
